Requirements:
    PyQt 4.7+ or PySide
    python 2.7+ (no python 3 support yet)
    numpy, scipy

    Known to run on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

Support:
    Post at the mailing list / forum:
    https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pyqtgraph

Installation:
    Pyqtgraph currently does not have (or really require) any installation 
    scripts. All that is needed is for the pyqtgraph folder to be placed 
    someplace importable. Most people will prefer to simply place this folder 
    within a larger project folder. If you want to make pyqtgraph available 
    system-wide, copy the folder to one of the directories listed in python's 
    sys.path list.

Documentation:
    There are many examples; run "python -m pyqtgraph.examples" for a menu
    Some (incomplete) documentation exists at this time.
    - Easiest place to get documentation is at 
      http://http://luke.campagnola.me/code/pyqtgraph/documentation
    - If you acquired this code as a .tar.gz file from the website, then you can also look in 
      pyqtgraph/documentation/html.
    - If you acquired this code via BZR, then you can build the documentation using sphinx.
      From the documentation directory, run:
          $ make html  
    Please feel free to pester Luke or post to the forum if you need a specific 
    section of documentation.
