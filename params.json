With the laser scan we are implementing simple feature detection, for highly continuous maze traveling.Our modded iRobot Create assembly is named **old-subdivision**. Old subdivision features rubber bumpers, a sonar array, Microsoft Kinect, and an expanded 1/8\" smoked polycarbonate cargo bay. In the works is 12V regulation for the Kinect.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Blog updates\r\n\r\n[Starting ROS with perception](http://patienceandplanning.blogspot.com/2012/04/gunncs-iaroc-starting-with-ros-and.html)\r\n\r\n[Hardware: old-subdivision](http://patienceandplanning.blogspot.com/2012/04/gunncs-iaroc-starting-with-ros-and.html)\r\n\r\n_For more updates, see [the blog](http://patienceandplanning.blogspot.com/). directly_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"gunncs's navigation code for the iaroc competition","google":"UA-31293544-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
